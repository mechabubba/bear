If you've made something using sandplate, feel free to share it on our [discussions forum](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate/discussions/categories/projects-using-sandplate)!

Pull requests/code contributions are accepted & encouraged, but share your intentions and get in touch via making an issue, commenting on one that exists, or joining the discord so we can discuss it beforehand üëç

If you don't have something to specific in mind, but want to help out, these labels are a good place to start:

- [`good first issue`](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate/labels/good%20first%20issue) Issues that are aren't too complex and could be taken care of relatively easily.

- [`help wanted`](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate/labels/help%20wanted) Highlights an issue as needing attention from other developers, such as a bug we can't figure out or something that needs worked on more urgently than other stuff. Usually more complex than the issues in the other label.

### [Branches](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate/branches)

The main branch is treated as the latest stable version. Future versions have their own "in development" branches, awaiting their completion and merge into `main`.

### ESLint

We make use of [ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) to keep code consistent, so having it alongside the appropriate plugin(s) for your editor of choice will help your workflow.

```bash
# locally
npm install eslint

# globally
npm install --global eslint
```
