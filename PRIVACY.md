# Privacy
bear takes only the following information in;
- Necessary Data
  - This includes any data necessary for a command to function. For example, the `bear` command stores the amount of times it was ran, and the `remindme` command stores reminders and provided reminder data.
- Temporary Command Usage
  - For 15 minutes after being ran, the bot stores the command ran, the issuers user ID, the channel ID, the guild ID, and the time it was run.

bear does not use any of this data in a harmful way, such as for personalization or tracking; it exists solely for the security of the system. Any data scraping and selling is outside of the scope of the project and also [against the Discord Developer Policy.](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy)

This isn't a license, I'm not a lawyer, this is not legalese, blah blah blah.
