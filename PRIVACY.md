# Privacy
Theres been a lot of talk recently about how many widely used bots - FredBoat, Ayana, Carl, etc. - are owned by BotLabs, a subsidiary of BlueStacks, whom of which enforces a concerning privacy policy over the bots.

bear takes only the following information in;
- Necessary Data
  - This includes any data necessary for a command to function. For example, the `bear` command stores the amount of times it was ran, and the `remindme` command stores reminders and provided reminder data.
- Command Usage
  - This includes your user ID, the command, and the time the command was ran.
  - 01/30/22: These logs are currently identifiable to the user who ran the command, however an anonymous "temporary" solution is in the works. This is strictly for moderation purposes, and to make sure no one is trying to DDoS the bot or use it to break Discord's TOS.

bear does not use any of this data in a harmful way, such as for personalization or tracking.

A chat bot for any service should only be used as a tool, and nothing more; any data scraping and selling is outside of the scope of the project and also [against the Discord Developer Policy.](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy)

This isn't a license, I'm not a lawyer, this is not legalese, blah blah blah.
