# Sandplate

Sandplate is a boilerplate/template discord.js bot, and a sandbox for new ideas/concepts/testing.

It's purpose is essentially to be the "basics" of your discord.js bot- this includes, but is not limited to:

- Improved console logging (timestamps and logging levels/labels)
- Command handler/framework with reloadable commands
- Message parser to run commands
- Event handler/framework with reloadable events
- Ability to login either with a persisted token (stored in config.json) or non-persisted (command prompt argument)

### Documentation (& a forewarning to aspiring developers)

However, it's purpose is **not** to skip learning how to code these things- In fact, to use sandplate properly, you will need to understand how they're implemented, along with how to use them, and I don't use the word "understand" lightly.

That said, for programmers, the barrier to entry will be very small- The project will launch when it reaches v1.0.0 internally, which includes fully fledged documentation :)

If you don't know javascript, or have never programmed before, then please read [this](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate/wiki/Resources#learning-javascript)

## Invites

The bot account itself is private for the time being. After the project goes live, the bot will be freely addable.
