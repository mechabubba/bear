*"the best discord bot"* â€” @everyone

bear [stylized accordingly] is my Discord bot. Invite the bot [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=435224030459723776&scope=bot&permissions=8); this link will automatically give it the "`ADMINISTRATOR`" permission.

bear is a modified fork of [sandplate](https://github.com/06000208/sandplate), a powerful template bot. See its readme for more information.

## Installing
1. `git clone https://github.com/mechabubba/bear.git`.
2. Enter the folder and run `npm i`.
3. Install a bunch of shit;
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install fortune-mod cowsay latex
```
4. Compile [`mathtex`](https://github.com/mechabubba/mathtex) (name the binary `mathtex`) and throw that in the bin folder.

## Launching
Running `node index.js` initially will create a config.json file in the data folder. Throw a bot token in there under `client.token` and now you're cooking with gas.

## Contributing
This is my bot, so every contribution is under heavy scrutiny because bear is my little scrunkly. But if you feel the need to add something or fix something, then please create a PR. Might get closed flat out, might not. Shits a gamble, man.

Feel free to join the Discord server up by the header to share your thoughts.
