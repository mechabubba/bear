# Sandplate

Sandplate is a boilerplate/template discord.js bot, and a sandbox for new ideas/concepts/testing.

Repo is currently without code at the moment, it'll be pushed when it's ready, and anyone will be welcome to contribute from then on.

## Trello

Sandplate has a trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/nHqrWfYR/sandplate), at which can see how the project is progressing.

## Invites

The bot account itself is private for the time being. After the project goes live, the bot will be freely addable.
